# Detection of Sexist Tweets - ChatGPT Prompts

This repository contains the prompt used to generate explanations for why tweets were labeled as **sexist** (1) or **non-sexist** (0) using **GPT-4o (version 2024-08-01)**. The goal is to enhance the transparency and interpretability of our classification model by providing clear explanations for its decisions.

## Overview

The prompt is designed to guide GPT-4o in generating detailed explanations for tweets classified as sexist or non-sexist. Given that the tweets we are analyzing are in **Spanish**, the prompt is written in **Spanish** as well. However, for practical purposes, the prompt has also been translated into **English** in this repository.
